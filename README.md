sternchen_reporter
==================

custom actano mocha reporter (in memorial of my lovely mother sheep sternchen)

set the global state require('chai').Assertion.includeStack = true
to enforce stacktrace for chai AssertionErrors.
you must use the same chai version as in your project to get it work
